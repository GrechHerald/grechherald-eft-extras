# GrechHerald's EFT Extras
A pack of some additional attachments I created for my own use in darsu's EFT and for roleplay purposes.
This pack includes:
- Rate of Fire Increase (10%, 20%, 25% and 50%)
- Rate of Fire Decrease (10%, 20%, 25% and 50%)
- Burst Fire Selectors (2, 3, 4 and 5 round burst, can switch to semi auto)
- Recoil Buffs as standalone (full and lite)
- Explosive .50AE bullets (REQUIRES ARC9 EFT DESERT EAGLE)
- Ergonomics+ for faster ADS speed
- Player Coloured Tracers (PCT) that use Physgun Colour for the tracers
- Viewmodel Position intended for the M1A, inspired from classics like Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare (it is in the Custom Slot)
- Bipod versions of the SOCOM 16 stock and RSASS Handguard
- Recoil Lite icon
- Spread Increase and Decrease attachments
- Alt Rifle Hold Positions (M40 hold, SV-98 hold 1 & 2, Rifle hold 3)
- 20% Faster Cycling for Bolt actions
- RS47 handguard with GP-25 UBGL support
- patched version of the CNC OV GP Black handguard for the AK
- Runaway Burst Fire Options
- KS-23M Steel Stock with GP-25 Recoil Pad
- PCT V2 that uses Player Colour instead of Physgun Colour
- Burst Fire Selector icons replacing the old ones
- CAR-15 and M4 handguards that allow M-LOK grips and 4.1 inch rails on them (very tactical)
- AN/PEQ-2 that can be mounted on more tactical slots than just the top one (appears as duplicate on some slots, nothing can be done about it and it's identical to the EFT one anyway)
- Universal Mk12 Gen 1 Gas Block that can be used on any AR-15 barrel (will appear duplicated on 16 inch, 18 inch and 20 inch barrels)
- Tracers separate from the buffs attachment, comes in the default colour (will be overriden by the current ammo type if the ammo has a tracer), Blue, Green, Purple, Red, White and Yellow
