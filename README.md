# GrechHerald's EFT Extras
A pack of some additional attachments I created for my own use in darsu's EFT and for roleplay purposes.
This pack includes:
- Rate of Fire Increase/Decrease (10%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 50%)
- Burst Fire Selectors (2, 3, 4 and 5 round burst, can switch to semi auto, Runaway versions)
- Recoil Buffs as standalone (full and lite)
- Explosive .50AE bullets (REQUIRES ARC9 EFT DESERT EAGLE)
- Ergonomics+ for faster ADS speed
- Player Coloured Tracers (PCT) that use Physgun Colour or Player Colour (V2) for the tracers
- Alt Rifle Hold Positions (M21 hold, M40 hold, SV-98 hold 1 & 2, Rifle hold 3), inspired from classics like Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare (they are in the Custom Slot)
- Bipod versions of the SOCOM 16 stock and RSASS Handguard
- Spread Increase and Decrease attachments
- 20% Faster Cycling for Bolt and Pump actions
- RS47 handguard with GP-25 UBGL support
- Patched version of the CNC OV GP Black handguard for the AK
- KS-23M Steel Stock with GP-25 Recoil Pad
- CAR-15, M4 and M16A2 handguards that allow M-LOK grips and 4.1 inch rails on them and tac lights and lasers for the M16A2 one (very tactical)
- AN/PEQ-2 that can be mounted on more tactical slots than just the top one (appears as duplicate on some slots, nothing can be done about it and it's identical to the EFT one anyway)
- Universal Mk12 Gen 1 Gas Block that can be used on any AR-15 barrel (will appear duplicated on 16 inch, 18 inch and 20 inch barrels)
- Tracers separate from the buffs attachment, comes in the default colour (will be overriden by the current ammo type if the ammo has a tracer), Blue, Green, Purple, Red, White and Yellow
- Duplicate Hanson and Mk12 16 inch Barrels that can mount the M4FS
- Patched version of the M16 Heatshield Handguard from MillsTC's M16A4 port (content packed in just in case that port is deleted so it doesn't need it, all credit goes to MillsTC for that one)
- Auto Selector with hilarious icon and proper selector positions
- Jam chance Increase/Decrease (25%)
- Reload Speed Increase/Decrease (10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50%)
