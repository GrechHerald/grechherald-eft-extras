# GrechHerald's EFT Extras
A pack of some additional attachments I created for my own use in darsu's EFT and for roleplay purposes.
This pack includes:
- Rate of Fire Increase (10%, 20%, 25% and 50%)
- Rate of Fire Decrease (10%, 20%, 25% and 50%)
- Burst Fire Selectors (2, 3, 4 and 5 round burst, can switch to semi auto)
- Recoil Buffs as standalone (full and lite)
- Explosive .50AE bullets (REQUIRES ARC9 EFT DESERT EAGLE)
- Ergonomics+ for faster ADS speed
- Player Coloured Tracers (PCT) that use Physgun Colour for the tracers
- Viewmodel Position intended for the M1A, inspired from classics like Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare (it is in the Custom Slot)
- Bipod versions of the SOCOM 16 stock and RSASS Handguard
- Recoil Lite icon
- Spread Increase and Decrease attachments
- Alt Rifle Hold Positions (M40 hold, SV-98 hold 1 & 2, Rifle hold 3)
- 20% Faster Cycling for Bolt actions
- RS47 handguard with GP-25 UBGL support
- patched version of the CNC OV GP Black handguard for the AK
- Runaway Burst Fire Options
- KS-23M Steel Stock with GP-25 Recoil Pad
- PCT V2 that uses Player Colour instead of Physgun Colour
- Burst Fire Selector icons replacing the old ones
- CAR-15 and M4 handguards that allow M-LOK grips and 4.1 inch rails on them (very tactical)
